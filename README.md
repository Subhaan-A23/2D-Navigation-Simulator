# 2D-Navigation-Simulator
The purpose of this project is to simulate and test different 2D navigation algoritms.

The simulator relies on PyGame to display a robot moving across a grid to get to a goal. The robot must avoid obstacles in the way and the starting position of the robot and the goal position
is random everytime the goal is reached. The number of obstacles can be customised and they are randomly placed after the goal is reached.

What the simulator looks like?

This project is not complete and has yet to implement different path planning algorithms, they include:
-BFS
-Djikstras
-A*
-RRT

Other functionality to include are:
-Timer 
-Variable speed
-API for custom path planning algorithms
